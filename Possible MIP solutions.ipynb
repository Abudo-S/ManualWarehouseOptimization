    "### Trade-offs\n",
    "- In case of separated MIP solvers [one for operator activation and one for scheduling & mission assignment]: Isolating the operator activation MIP problem from the scheduling MIP problem, might generate overscheduled orders per the activated operators? in the other hand, if we merge both problems in one MIP, the objective function wouldn't be focalized only on the scheduling or on the operator activation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  Why Overscheduling might occur:  \n",
    "  The preliminary activation MIP solves a static, simplified problem:  \n",
    "  $$\\text{Minimize } \\sum_{i \\in I} y_{i} \\text{ which is subject to } \\sum_{j} x_{ij}⋅P_{ij} \\le H_{fixed}$$ where $y_{i}$ is the activation variable of operator i and $H_{fixed}$ is the number of fixed work hours (ex. 20 hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Blindness to Travel Time: The first MIP solver looks only at processing time ($P_{ij}$). It determines the minimum number of operators necessary to cover the workload hours. It assumes travel time ($T_{jk}$) is either zero or a negligible constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Overscheduled Output: When we pass the result (the minimum number of operators) to the second Scheduling MIP/GNN, the travel time suddenly becomes a factor. That \"minimal\" team might find that the required routing and travel time pushes their total shift length well past the $H_{fixed}$ limit, or critically, pushes the Makespan (Z) to an unacceptable level.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In case of combined MIP solvers [only one solver for operatora activation, scheduling and mission assignment]: the objective function would be a weighted combination for a multi-objective problem.\n",
    "$$\\text{Minimize } Z_{\\text{Total}} = \\left( \\alpha \\cdot Z_{\\text{Makespan}} \\right) + \\left( \\beta \\cdot \\sum_{i \\in I} y_i \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Enforcing the Trade-off: The single objective function forces the solver (MIP or GNN) to find a solution where the marginal benefit of reducing time ($Z$) is perfectly balanced against the marginal cost of labor ($\\sum y_i$), according to your chosen weights ($\\alpha$ and $\\beta$).\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The Solver's Focus: The solver is still entirely \"focalized\" but its focus is on achieving the best possible compromise.If $\\alpha$ is large and $\\beta$ is small, the focus is almost entirely on scheduling ($Z$).If $\\beta$ is large and $\\alpha$ is small, the focus is almost entirely on activation ($\\sum y_i$).  \n",
    "\n",
    "  => But determining the optimal alpha and beta is a second problem of optimality!  \n",
    "   Determining the optimal weights ($\\alpha$ and $\\beta$) is often considered a separate, higher-level optimization problem, it moves from tactical scheduling to strategic decision-making.\n",
    "    * $\\beta$ (Labor Cost): This is usually a fixed, hard cost. It represents the financial penalty associated with activating one additional full-time operator (e.g., salary, benefits, overhead, per hour or per shift).\n",
    "    * $\\alpha$ (Time Cost): This is the cost associated with one unit of Makespan time (e.g., the cost of delaying downstream processes, lost throughput opportunity, inventory holding cost, or customer service penalty).  \n",
    "\n",
    "  Example: If hiring one operator costs 50 euro per hour, and the penalty for delaying the makespan by one hour is judged to be 100 euro, then:\n",
    "  $$\\beta = 50, \\alpha = 100$$\n",
    "  Obviously, it might be needed to normalize them.  \n",
    "  Some techniques are used to explore the solution space and guide the decision-maker:\n",
    "    * The Epsilon-Constraint Method: it generates the \"Pareto Front\", a curve showing the minimum number of operators required for any given makespan target. The decision-maker then visually chooses the point on the curve that best fits the company's budget and service goals.\n",
    "    * Utility Function Elicitation: involves working with stakeholders to define a business strategy or Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to formally decide the relative importance of labor cost vs. time cost."
